# Possible Analyses
We can choose two variables such as weaning age and adult mass and see if we can fit a linear model to it or see if there is a correlation.
We are interested in seeing linear relationships which may require us to transformation the data. 

# Possible results tables
Our tables will describe the GLM we use. The tables will include the term, estimates, confidence intervals, and p-value.  


# Possible results figures
A line graph may be most appropriate to show this data and use facets or different colours to show the differences/similarities between orders and families.
