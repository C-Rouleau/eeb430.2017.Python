## Maximum Life Span

Figure 3, generated by the linear mixed model effect shows us that there is a negative correlation between number of offspring produced per year and the life span of the mother. Using orders as the random effect, the linear mixed effects model was a better fit for the data with a lower AIC rank of 714.4 in comparison to the generalized linear model which had a AIC rank of 837.0 (Table 1). Though this negative correlation is seen for all 7 mammalian orders, the correlation for some orders were stronger since their slopes were more negative, such *Carnivora* (-1.2317), *Primates* (-1.01260), and *Artiodactyla* (-0.6997) (Table 1).
